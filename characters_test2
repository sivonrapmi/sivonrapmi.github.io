<p>> Thoughts spiral in his head. A part of him tells him to run back, he doesn’t have to do this, it’s not worth it-

The other part of him that wants to fight says Fuck the government.

He stands in front of the door, keys in hand, and takes a deep breath.

There’s no going back once he opens it.

The door unlocks, and he rushes in, wasting no time as he goes up to the printer and switches the book stamps to the ones of his essay. The Writer immediately runs to the side of the printer and pulls the lever. With bated breath he waits for the tell-tale sounds of rubber marching across fields of paper, as if filled with new purpose.

The machine comes to life.</p>

<p>> It’s a long walk from the alleyway to the apartment, through the deserted street. The cold night air bites at Martin’s cheeks as he limps onwards. His pace doubled the time he had to arrive; So when he finally set foot inside his unit, he immediately slammed the door behind him.</p>
<p>> He winces when the lock clicks into place, and his eyes immediately adjust to the darkness. The apartment is small and cramped, with peeling wallpaper and an old, musty smell. It's not home, but it's shelter.</p>
<p>> Martin dumps his bag on the floor and collapses onto the couch. The adrenaline has long worn off. Now, all he feels is a bone-deep exhaustion. His whole body aches, and every time he tries to heave air into his lungs, he’s made aware of the large, purple bruises starting to blossom on his skin. </p>
<p>> It had been a rough night.</p>
